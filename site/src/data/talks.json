      "description": "Recursion is elegant, but stack overflows are not. What if there was a way to recurse indefinitely without hitting stack limits, even in languages that don't support tail call optimization? This talk explores an unexpected solution inspired by Clojure, implemented in Ruby with nothing but clever stack management. Through visual examples and step-by-step breakdowns we'll learn to bounce on trampolines and save our stack.",

      "description": "LiveView is greatâ€”until it has to live somewhere else.\n\nWhether you're integrating with a third-party site, building a white-label solution, or exposing your app as a widget, operating outside your own domain introduces a new class of problems. LiveView starts to feel boxed in, and the usual tooling for cookies, headers, and sockets doesn't quite behave as expected.\n\nIn this talk, we'll dig into the challenges and tradeoffs of embedding Phoenix apps into third-party domains. And when to choose between iframes and custom elements as delivery mechanisms.",
